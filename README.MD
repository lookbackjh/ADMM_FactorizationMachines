## Todo

this repository is responsible for implementing [Stochastic Distributed MAtrix Factorization with ADMM](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/paper/CIKM14_DSADMM.pdf)

run `admm.py` to test the admm version of matrix factorization and run `main.py` to test the original matrix factorization

detailed implementaion are to be updated soon....
