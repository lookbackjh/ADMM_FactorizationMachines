## Todo

this repository is responsible for implementing [Stochastic Distributed MAtrix Factorization with ADMM](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/paper/CIKM14_DSADMM.pdf)

run `admm.py` to test the admm version of matrix factorization and run `main.py` to test the original matrix factorization

This implementation is naive and basic, so detailed functions have not been implemented yet, and the code may be a bit messy.

Detailed implementations and code cleanup things  are planned to be updated soon...
